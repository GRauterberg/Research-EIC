Welcome! I am a law professor at the University of Michigan. While most of my research concerns current developments in corporate law, securities regulation, and investment management, I also study the history of the business corporation. This page hopes to help people explore the value and interest of digitizing historical texts to better understand economic and business history.

Stay tuned! I hope to use this site to showcase the amazing work of UM undergraduates in the School of Information. They are helping to make amazing pieces of 17th century economic history legible and machine readable for a modern audience.
