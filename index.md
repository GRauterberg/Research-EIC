Welcome! I am a law professor at the University of Michigan. While most of my research concerns current day issues and developments in corporate law, securities regulation, and investment management, I also study the history of the business corporation. This page hopes to help people explore the value and interest of digitizing historical texts to better understand economic and business history.

Stay tuned as I show the amazing work of UM undergraduates in the School of Information as they push the frontiers of making 17th century documents from business history legible and machine readable for a modern audience.
